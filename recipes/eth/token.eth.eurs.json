    "info":"<p>Statis Euro (EURS) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the Euro. The initial idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital euro. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable euro substitute are called “stable coins.” EURS mirrors the value of the Euro on the blockchain, and is said to be supported by liquidity assurance mechanisms combining the benefits of a global fiat with the transparency, immutability and efficiency of the blockchain. According to their website, all tokens are fully backed by 1:1 collateral reserves. The company aims to promote transparency by providing daily statements from account providers along with weekly verifications and quarterly audits by a top 5 global accounting firm.</p>",
