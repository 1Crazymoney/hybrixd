<h3>Welcome to the hybrix Javascript Library guide</h3>

This library can be used to connect software to leverage the capabilities of the hybrix platform. It serves two purposes: first to facilitate the logistics of interfacing with the hybrixd REST API, secondly to handle all client side operations securely and privately. This ensures that keys required for transaction never leave the users device and communication over an encrypted channel.

  <h3>Getting started</h3>

  <p>There are two flavours of the library: the web version to include in your webpage or front-end; and the node js version to include when you are building back-end software.</p>

  <p>Here is a Hello World example of how to use hybrixd-lib.js in your front-end. First include the library
    using script tags.</p>

  <pre>
    &lt;html&gt;
    &nbsp;&lt;head&gt;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script src='hybrixd-lib.web.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &nbsp;&lt;/head&gt;
    &nbsp;&lt;body&gt;
     &nbsp;&lt;script&gt;
       var hybrix = new Hybrix.Interface({XMLHttpRequest:XMLHttpRequest});
       hybrix.sequential(
        [
         'init',                                                        // Initialize hybrix
        ],
        ()=>{alert('Hello World!');},                                   // Define action to execute on succesfull completion
        error=>{alert('Oops, something went wrong: '+error);}     // Define action to exectue when an error is encountered
       );
     &nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;
    &nbsp;&lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;</pre>

 <p>For nodejs projects:</p>

 <pre>
    //TODO include nacl
    var Hybrix = require('hybrix-lib.nodejs.js');
    var hybrix = new Hybrix.Interface({http:require('http')});
    hybrix.sequential(
     [
      'init',                                                        // Initialize hybrix
     ],
     ()=>{console.log('Hello World!');},                             // Define action to execute on succesfull completion
     error=>{console.log('Oops, something went wrong: '+error);}     // Define action to exectue when an error is encountered
    );</pre>


 <h3>Callbacks</h3>

 Each command is implemented as a member function of the Hybrix.Interface class. Adding a host be done as follows:

 <pre>hybrix.addHost({host:'https://www.myhost.io'});</pre>

 <p>Each member function has four parameters: data, onSucces, onError and onProgress.</p>

 <p>The first is used to pass parameter data to the function, the last three are callback functions. onSucces is called once when the method has finished succesfully. onError is called once when an error is called. onProgress is called whenever an progress update is available, passing a number between 0 and 1, and 1 upon completion.</p>

 <p>To first Initialize the interface, then add a host and then add an asset one could do the following:</p>

 <pre>
hybrix.init();                                                     // This is an asynchronious function. It can take some time to complete.
hybrix.addHost({host:'https://www.myhost.io'});  <font color="red">// Problem! This will try to add the host before the initialization is done.</font>
hybrix.addAsset({symbol:'btc'});                 <font color="red">// Problem! This will try to add the host before the initialization and/or addition of the host is done.</font>
 </pre>

But that result in serious problems due to asynchronicity. One could use the callbacks to ensure execute order.

 <pre>hybrix.init(null,
                  function(){
                    hybrix.addHost({host:'https://www.myhost.io'}, // This will now be called after initialization is succesfully completed.
                      function(){
                       hybrix.addAsset({symbol:'btc'};             // This will now be called after adding the host is succesfully completed.
                      }
                    );
                  }
                 );</pre>

 <p>Note that adding more steps or error handling will end up with code that is both very hard to read and maintain. (Sometimes dubbed as 'callback hell'.) To mitigate this the library comes equiped with a sequential and a parallel command to handle these asynchronious call flows. With an added bonus of handling the progress for combined commands as well.</p>

 <pre>
  hybrix.sequential([
    'init',                                                        // Initialize hybrix
    {host: 'http://localhost:1111/'},  'addHost',                  // Add and initialize the host
    {symbol: 'dummy'}, 'addAsset'                                  // Add the asset
  ],
   onSucces,                                                       // Define action to execute on succesfull completion
   onError,                                                        // Define action to exectue when an error is encountered
   onProgress                                                      // Define action to exectue whenever there is a progress update
  );
 </pre>


 <p>For even more complex behaviour we advice you to implement your own favourite flavour method of handling the call flow, be it promises, streams, or async etc.</p>
