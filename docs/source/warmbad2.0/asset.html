<h1>Adding assets to hybrix</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are three levels of complexity when adding a new asset or coin
to hybrix.

<ol>
  <li>A token based on an already supported chain.</li>
  <li>A chain derived from a supported chain.</li>
  <li>A completely new chain</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tokens</h3>

<p>For the first case, if the asset is a token based on an existing base chain, only a simplified <i>Node side
    module</i> or <i>recipe</i> needs to be defined. (Without qrtz / API endpoints definition
  as those will already be defined in the base asset recipe.). You
  can import the base recipe using the import property. See below for
    an example:</p>

<pre>
recipes/token.burst.lex.json
{
  "symbol":"burst.lex",
  "name":"Lex4All",
  "module":"quartz",</pre><pre style="font-weight:bold;">  "import":"burst",</pre><pre>  "mode":"nxt.burst-token",
  "contract":"2264511436216725766",
  "originator":"BURST-KN9G-WJH6-BGAA-GWLWF",
  "factor":0
}
</pre>

<h3>New chains and derived chains</h3>

<p>To add a new crypto currency as asset you will need a <i>Client side
  module</i> for deterministic cryptography and a <i>Node side module</i> or <i>recipe</i> to handle information requests. For derived chains you may be able to reuse either or both of the client and node side modules.</p>

<p>The <i>Client side module</i> will handle address and key generation and transaction signing.
  See <a href="./client.html">Client.</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The <i>Node side module</i> defines API endpoints in hybrixd that enables users and wallets to interact with
  other blockchains by translating and relaying calls
  to API endpoints from RPC's and block explorers for the given crypto
  currency. Please see below for instructions.</p>

<p>The following files are associated with the modules:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code> modules/deterministic/$ASSET/deterministic.js.lmza </code></dt><dd> The compiled
    Client side module. </dd>
  <dt><code> recipes/asset.$ASSET.json </code></dt><dd> The definition of the asset details
    and Node side module.</dd>
</dl>

TODO link to hybrix setup dev environment

<h2>Setup local dev environment</h2>

To build client side modules you will need to setup your local hybrix development environment. Including the deterministic modules.

See <a href="./dev.html">Setup local dev environment.</a>

<h2>Grocery List</h2>

<p>You will need the following information:</p>

<dl>
  <dt> Asset Details</dt><dd>
    <dl>
      <dt>Symbol</dt><dd>The symbol associated with the asset (Bitcoin has btc much like the US dollar has usd)</dd>
      <dt>Factor</dt><dd>The factor determines the nr of digits after the dot. (The precision of the currency) </dd>
      <dt>Fee</dt><dd>The transaction fee that is required as overhead payment for a transaction. </dd>
      <dt>Fee-Symbol</dt><dd>The symbol that is used to pay fees. This is usually the same value as Symbol name. </dd>
      <dt>Fee-Factor</dt><dd>The factor of the fee. This is usually the same value as Factor. </dd>
      <dt>Address Regex</dt><dd>The regex to which an address must
      comply to be valid. </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt>Hosts </dt><dd>The url's of API endpoints. Searching for '$ASSETNAME
    block explorer api' , '$ASSETNAME rpc'. The goal is to find API's
    where we can send requests for balances etc.<br/><br/></dd>

  <dt> API endpoints</dt><dd>
    Endpoints You will need api endpoints for the following. For example <u>https://nodes.wavesplatform.com</u>
    <dl>
      <dt>balance</dt><dd>The balance a given address. For example <code>/addresses/balance/$ADDRESS</code></dd>
      <dt>unspents </dt><dd> The unspents (pre-transactional data) for a given address. </dd>
      <dt>push </dt><dd>To submit a signed transaction to the blockchain. </dd>
      <dt>message/attachement </dt><dd> Retrieve the message, attachement or 'op_return'
        attached to an transaction. </dd>
      <dt>transaction </dt><dd> To retrieve details about a transaction </dd>
      <dt>history </dt><dd> To retrieve history for a given address.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt>Javascript library</dt><dd>
    To create a client side module you will need to wrap a library
    containing the following functions:
    <dl>
      <dt>seed to keys</dt><dd> A deterministic function to generate
      a public private key pair from a seed. </dd>
      <dt>keys to address </dt><dd> A function to retrieve the
      address belonging to a key pair  </dd>
      <dt>create and sign transaction </dt><dd>A function to create
        and sign (but not yet broadcast) a transaction. </dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>


</dl>

<p>Browse to <a href="https://api.hybrix.io">https://api.hybrix.io</a>
  and view 'asset' for more details on the API endpoints for assets.</p>

<h2>Client - Node separation</h2>

<p>The strict seperation between client and node is to ensure that private keys data always remains on the client side.<br/>
  The node should never touch this data. To facilitate this the node supplies a 'client code blob' : compressed javascript code that can be executed on the client side.<br/>
  The client does the signing. The ode handles the logistics.</p>

<h3>Node side module</h2>

<p>The node side module serves as a relay between APIs.</p>

<p>For example: when you query hybrixd for the balance of your waves address:  <code>/asset/waves/$ADDRESS</code>
  this will be routed to the Node side  module defined in
  <code>recipes/asset.waves.json</code>. <br/>
  The logic there (written in Qrtz) will reformat the request to
  <u>https://nodes.wavesplatform.com/addresses/balance/details/$YOUR_ADDRESS</u> <br/>
  it will retrieve the result, extract the required information, reformat that and return the standardized end result.
</p>

<p>The Node side module is defined using a json recipe containing the
  asset properties and the logic implemented in qrtz ("Quartz") .</p>

See <a href="./node.html">Node side modules / Recipes </a>

<h2>Client side module</h2>

<p>A deterministic module is a client side module for hybrixd. It is used
  to handle client seeds, keys addresses and signing. As we
  do not want a client to share their keys all these actions should be
  performed client side. The node should never touch this data.
  To facilitate this the node supplies a 'client code blob' : compressed
  javascript code that can be executed on the client side.</p>
