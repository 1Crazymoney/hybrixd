<p><i>qrtz</i> is the processing language for hybrixd. It is used to handle routing requests. Each routing request spawns a process that follows <i>qrtz</i> steps to a result, or a failure.</p>
<p>A <i>qrtz</i> command always consists of 4 characters. The parameters are appended in either a space or a comma separated fashion:</p>

<p><code>head parameter1 parameter2 ...</code></p>

<p><code>head(parameter1,parameter2,...)</code></p>

  <h3>Recipe</h3>

  <p>Recipes are JSON files that contain parameters and <i>qrtz</i> methods for asset handling, data source queries or actionable engines. A recipe, depending on what it does, fits in one of three categories: asset, source, or engine.</p>
  <p>A source-recipe in principle contains only methods to query read-only data sources.</p>
  <p>An engine-recipe contains methods to perform actions based on incoming data, business logic and often interfaces with other programming languages.</p>
  <p>An asset-recipe contains methods to query value-related ledger or cryptocurrency API's. It returns path options to the hybrixd routing engine for users or machines to perform actions like, for example, querying the balance of an address.</p>
  <p>The categories above make it easier to instantly recognize the functionality of a recipe, and analyze it from the proper context. Source and engine recipes are interpreted identically by the scheduler, however, they are available through separate paths: <code>/source</code> and <code>/engine</code>. Asset recipes are specifically tailored to be used in the context of decentralized banking, and are available through the routing path: <code>/asset</code>.</p>

  <h3>Data flow</h3>

  <p>Every step in a <i>qrtz</i> recipe has the potential to alter the data of the process in which the script is running. Process data is available by using the dollar sign <code>$</code>. It is also available as input to every new process step. It behaves like a variable in <i>qrtz</i> in that it can be read anywhere, however, the difference with a variable is that the data of the process can be changed by every step of the process. The design consideration is that this coaxes you to design your <i>qrtz</i> script with a concise data flow in mind.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of some <i>qrtz</i> steps and the resulting data flow.</p>
  <code>
  data 'Hello dog!'       // data 'Hello dog!'    - set the data of the process
  pull -4                 // data 'Hello '        - pulls the last 4 characters
  repl ' ' 'world!'       // data 'Hello world!'  - replaces the ' ' (space) by 'world!'
  </code>

  <h3>Variables and Scopes</h3>

  <p><code>$</code> the main stream variable it is the output of the previous step. Use <code>$$</code> to escape the dollar sign (for example in regular expressions). </p>
  <p><code>$.property</code></p>

  <p><code>$variable</code>  Retrieve a propery from the recipe.(read only) (falls back to proc:: scope if no recipe variable is found)</p>
  <p><code>$local::variable</code>  or <code>$::variable</code> Use a local scope (maintained between all processes spawned from the same recipe).</p>
  <p><code>$proc::variable</code> process scope.</p>
  <p><code>$otherRecipe::variable</code> the local scope of another recipe (read only)</p>
