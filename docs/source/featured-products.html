<h3>Featured products</h3>
Here are some examples of products that are powered by the <i>hybrix</i> node environment
and javascript library.

This is the CLI command line wallet that you can use to perform transactions, query for blockchain

<h3>Web wallet</h3>
We host the Internet of Coins web wallet that is also available as part of a standard <i>hybrixd</i>
node installation. It enables users to store and manage their cryptocurrencies in a completely
decentralized way, and is big on privacy, by not storing any user data.
